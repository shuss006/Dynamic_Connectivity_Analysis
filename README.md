# Sana Hussain

Hello,

My name is Sana Hussain and I am a 3rd year PhD student at UC Riverside.  I currently work under the advisement of Dr. Xiaoping Hu and Dr. Megan Peters.  As part of my graduate studies I have written the above scripts which are coupled as described below:

The first set of scripts (dynamic_connectivity_analysis.m and rest_filter.m) analyze the dynamic functional connectivity between networks' BOLD signals.  Specifically, this code utilizes inputs of fMRI data and ROI masks created in FSL in the form of nifti files to acquire the static and dynamic connectivity measurements between the ROIs in a network.  Included in the script is also code for a series of plots to visualize the results.

The second set of scripts (Bayesian_analysis.m and Bayesian_analysis_function.m) employ Bayes' rule to determine whether a subject squezed a squeeze-ball given his/her network connectivity patterns.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you!
