# Sana Hussain

Hello!

My name is Sana Hussain and I am a 3rd year PhD student at UC Riverside.  I currently work under the advisement of Dr. Xiaoping Hu and Dr. Megan Peters.  I have created code (dynamic_connectivity_analysis.m and rest_filter.m) as a part of my graduate student project to analyze the dynamic connectivity between networks' BOLD signals.  Specifically, this code utilizes inputs of fMRI data and ROI masks created in FSL in the form of nifti files to acquire the static and dynamic connectivity measurements between the ROIs in a network.

I have also created another set of code (Bayesian_analysis.m and Bayesian_analysis_function.m) that employs Bayes' rule to determine whether a subject squeezed a squeeze-ball given his/her network connectivity pattern.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions! Thank you!
