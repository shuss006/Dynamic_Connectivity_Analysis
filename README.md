# Sana Hussain

Hello,

My name is Sana Hussain and I am a 3rd year PhD student at UC Riverside.  I currently work under the advisement of Dr. Xiaoping Hu and Dr. Megan Peters.  As part of my graduate studies I have written the above scripts in MATLAB which are briefly described below, and described in futher detail in the m files.

main_script.m calls extract_BOLD.m to extract the BOLD signal from designated ROIs, while LC_analysis.m extracts the signal from an LC atlas used in our lab.  It calls static_corrletion.m to perform a static correlation between the BOLD signal of ROIs, and calls dynamic_connectivity.m to analyze the dynamic functional connectivity using a sliding time window analysis.  rest_filter.m is a bandpass filter.  Included in the scrip is also code for a series of plots to visualize the results. 

The second set of scripts (Bayesian_analysis.m and Bayesian_analysis_function.m) employ Bayes' rule to determine whether a subject squeezed a squeeze-ball given his/her network connectivity patterns.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you!
